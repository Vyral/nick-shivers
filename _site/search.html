        "content": "During the fourth quarter, our super-hot sellerâs market will transition into more of a neutral market. However, our market is still in great shape overall.What can you expect from our Portland Metro/Southwest Washington market during the fourth quarter? There are several trends youâll want to watch out for.First, the average number of days homes spend on the market will increase. This means if youâre listing your house, you probably wonât be able to sell it as quickly.Â We should also see inventory increase. During October 1 and 2 of this year, there were 169 expired listings (properties that hit the market but didnât sell) in the Portland Metro area. During the same two-day period in 2017, there were 63 expired listings. And in 2016, there were just 48. Why the increase? People are overpricing their properties.Â Next, price appreciation will slow down. However, since real estate is micro-local, certain areas and certain price points will see some nice appreciation.âThere will be fewer home sales compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.âYou should also expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Theyâre scheduled to meet two more times this year, so you can bet that theyâll raise rates so they can then take them back down and spur growth.Â Lastly, there will be fewer home sales compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.Overall, youâll see our super-hot sellerâs market shift into more of a neutral market. In some areas, we might even see a buyerâs market emerge. The good news is, our market is still great and our economy is still growing.Â As always, if you have any other questions about our market or youâre thinking of buying or selling a home soon, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd be happy to help you.",

        "content": "Our Portland market is shifting, so as a buyer, you need great intel and you need to look at all the comparable homes sold yourself.Our market is shifting here in Portland, and there are two keys to finding the right home if youâre a buyer.Â  Â First, when I say a âshifting market,â I mean weâre shifting into a neutral-to-slightly-depreciating market. As we know, real estate is micro-local, and certain areas are still in a strong sellerâs market. Overall though, the Portland market is shifting. Weâre seeing more price reductions and homes are spending more days on the market. Specifically, weâve seen a 63% increase in price reductions year over year.With that being said, the first key to taking advantage of these conditions is intel. You need to make sure your agent is asking sellers lots of questions. Do they understand that weâre in a shifting market? They should be able to provide data.âIf youâve had a tough time finding the right house, the fourth quarter will be a great time to get in the game.âThe second key is to look at the comps yourself. You canât look at comparable homes sold back in June or July, because it was a better market then than the one we have now.There are a lot of great opportunities for buyers out there right now. Thereâs more inventory available, and sellers are willing to negotiate. Interest rates are also still historically lowâpeople are freaking out because theyâre at 5%, but thatâs still an incredible rate. We should see a seasonal shift downward during the fourth quarter, so thatâll be an even greater opportunity for buyers. If youâve had a tough time finding the right house, the fourth quarter will be a great time to get in the game.If you have any other questions about our market or youâre thinking of selling a home soon, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "content": "What do sellers need to know in a shifting real estate market? Today Iâll discuss four key points sellers should think about.What even is a shifting real estate market? It doesnât mean that the market is going crazy like it did in 2010; it could mean several different things. For this discussion, Iâll be referencing the market specifically in Portland and Southwest Washington.In the Portland metro, the shifting market means this: Year over year, there have been 65% more price drops for the period of this last month. There are properties that are worth less money now than they were in, say, May.Â That is, in essence, what you should expect to see in a shifting marketâsome values dropping down, longer days on market, and more price reductions.Even still, our overall market is healthy. Here are some key points for sellers to think about:1. Active and pending listings are your key. When youâre looking for comps, you canât look at a property that sold in June or July because the fact is that the May market was better than it is now.2. Thereâs always a seasonal downturn in the fourth quarter. Values traditionally peak in July, but they peaked a little earlier this year.âIf you overprice your home in a shifting market that has either plateaued or is going down, then you could get yourself in trouble and lose value.â3. You need to prepare your home for sale before you list it. Â In early spring, you could just throw your property on the market without much prepping and still get offers on it, but you canât do that in this market. Competition from other sellers is hitting the marketâyou need to be sure that when youâre listing your home, itâs ready to go out of the gate.4. When listing your home, donât overprice it. If you overprice your home in a shifting market that has either plateaued or is going down, then you could get yourself in trouble and lose value.Â However, remember that real estate is micro-local: There are some neighborhoods in the Portland area that still donât have homes on the market. If Â we had to make a forecast for the fourth quarter, Iâd say to expect to see this trend continuing, especially with the seasonal downturn.If youâre planning on selling your home, be sure to follow these tips. If you have any questions in the meantime, please feel free to reach out to me.",

        "content": "A shift in the wind of the market has happened and today I am going to explain what it means for you.Itâs time once again for The Shiverâs Report, where I talk about the real estate market in the Portland Metro and Southwest Washington.So, what is going on? I believe that there truly has been a shift in the wind. In fact, we are going on four and a half months with fewer sales and more inventory. The reality, though, is that this is probably a good thing. This is because, as buyers already know, it has been a tough market.When we talk about inventory, days on market, slowdown, and appreciation, the shift isnât happeningâitâs already here.For the Portland Metroâs first two weeks of August, sales are down 8.7%. This has been the norm for the last three to three and a half months.Meanwhile, for the first time in Southwest Washington, we saw fewer sales than the year before, even though we had seen a massive pickup. This happened because of affordabilityâwe saw rates drop and then pick up again.Now people think that there will be a big downturn like in 2009 and 2010. However, the difference between now and then is our current interest rates are between 4.5% and 4.7%, whereas before the crash hit, they were at 6.5%. Thatâs a 2% difference.âWhen we talk about inventory, days on market, slowdown, and appreciation, the shift isnât happeningâitâs already hereâA 2% difference on a $400,000 property is a 20% difference in purchasing power. Even though affordability is starting to go up, home values in our area are higher than ever before and have hit their peak level. This is true as well in over 60% of all markets in the United States. All of this is good for sellers.Buyers, meanwhile, are starting to get more opportunities and more homes to choose from. You donât necessarily have to make multiple offers. If youâre looking below the $400,000 range, though, itâs still a super tight market. If you start stepping above that, especially in the luxury level, we have seen days on market and inventory levels go up significantly.If you have any questions about our market or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to reach out to me. I would love to speak with you.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today I want to talk about using artificial intelligence (AI) to sell your home.I have three topics for you today: robots, artificial intelligence (AI), and Zillow.Recently, Zillow stated that they can get you a 15% more accurate home evaluation with AI. Why is that? They use two different things: structured data and unstructured data. Structured data looks at things such as location, square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms. Unstructured data focuses on things like countertops and amenities.They are trying to figure out how to be more accurate so when they look at pictures they can differentiate between slab granite and tile granite. Their AI will pick up the pixels and differentiate between the landscaping, the facades, etc.I personally think this is pretty awesome. AI is a great technology and, as an agent, I think that I would use it. I think that our jobs are still safe and that Zillow is not going to ruin that. That is because even with AI, I think that Zillow will always struggle with being as accurate as a real estate agent when it comes to home evaluations.For example, there is a property at 9636 Knight Street in Portland that was on the market for $325,000. Zillow says it is worth $345,000 but it did not sell. The fact is, it is probably worth $300,000, so they are off about 14%. Whether it is 14% higher or lower, that is a big percentage difference in this market.Thereâs a home at 331 SE 7th Way in Camby, meanwhile, that was a Rocket Listing that Zillow says was worth $377,000. We had an offer on the table for that home for $400,000.âAI is a great technology and, as an agent, I think that I would use it.âWhy is that? It is difficult to get AI to understand market demand. While it can look at past sales, it cannot know today what the market demand is and it doesnât know about a homeâs specific, detailed location.The property on Knight Street backs up to a freeway with a huge wall, and thatâs going to affect its value. AI will never factor that into the details. Having bad neighbors will affect a homeâs value as well. Finally, perception will affect the value. What is the overall perception in the real estate market?In conclusion, while I do think that Zillow using AI is making it easier for consumers to get a good feel for home values, the fact is that if someone takes it as gospel, they are going to lose a lot of money. This is why I think that you need to have a great real estate professional who knows the market to help you make one of the biggest purchases of your life.If you have any additional questions or are interested in buying or selling, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to helping you.",

Today letâs review how the past few months have fared.&nbsp;How has our Southwest Washington market fared so far this year? Letâs take a look at the last few months.In April, closed sales rose 11% Â in Portland and 12% in Southwest Washington as a whole. And in May, Portland saw an 8% drop in closed sales and Southwest Washington overall saw a dip of 7%.Â But what about June? Well, much like we saw last month, June has seen closed sales drop 9% in Portland and 3% across Southwest Washington in general.What do these figures tell us about our market?Â One major thing we can take away from these trends is that thereâs a sense of apathy among buyers in our market lately. First-time buyers are struggling to secure a home, as listings in lower price points often see six or more offers. Even so, buyer traffic hasnât been as hot as it should be at this time of year.Â âI am very optimistic that all of the factors weâve discussed today will ultimately result in a stable summer market.âSo my hope for the months to come is that we start seeing more listings come onto our market.

Economic growth is strong and unemployment is low, so I am very optimistic that all of the factors weâve discussed today will ultimately result in a stable summer market.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

This is why my team created My Rocket Listingâa program thatâs as easy as âthree, two, one, sold.âLet me explain how this countdown to success looks like for sellers who use this program. Here are each of the steps:3. Contact us.2. Weâll run our algorithm and have an on-site evaluation.1. Within 24 hours, weâll get an offer for your home and give you a comparative market analysis showing what you could earn in a traditional market setting.âThe My Rocket Listing program is as easy as three, two, one, sold.âWith My Rocket Listing, you pick the closing and control the process. About 70% of consumers want a maximum-price offer for their home. But the remaining 30% are more interested in receiving a fair offer with maximum convenience, which is exactly what our program provides.Â Take one of our past clients, Larry, for example. Larry was moving to Florida and came to us to pursue our My Rocket Listing program. He told me that he just wanted to get the selling process over and done with so he could move on to his next home.

Consider a local lender.&nbsp;We are in a hot sellerâs season right now, which means competition among buyers is strong. This leaves many buyers wondering how they can set themselves, and their offer, apart.Â Today we are going to talk about why a local lender helps you stand out in a competitive, multiple offer situation.Â Our team helps sellers all the time. When we list a property, we look for buyers with more than just a pre-approval letter to reinforce their offer. Our team seeks out buyers who are working with a lender who can back them up, and who would be willing to reach out to us directly. I want a lender to be able to tell my team exactly why it is they believe a buyer is qualified.Â I want this for two reasons:Â 1. If they close deals, I might know them.Â 2. Iâm talking to them. Even in a text and email world, you want to be able to have at least a conversation. If you canât have a conversation, make sure that lender is sending out a video text.âI guarantee any top listing agent is going to look at  Quicken Loans a little bit differently than someone that we know gets deals done.âYou, as the consumer, may be thinking you are going to go to Quicken Loans and save a quarter of a percent. Well, the fact is that after everything is done, itâs about the same. Also, I guarantee any top listing agent is going to look at Quicken Loans a little bit differently than someone who we know gets deals done.Â In this market, if you want to win in a multiple offer situation, you need a lender that is proactive in the market, well-known, and willing to reach out on your behalf.Â If you have any further questions about why you should consider a local lender when purchasing your new home, please donât hesitate to ask.

Some of these people were children. My own kids were young at the time, and I saw some things at that landfill that inspired me to help the kids who lived there.I got involved with an organization called Forward Edge International, but I realized there was something more I could do. I believe everyone wants to make a difference, but sometimes you just donât know how. Thatâs when my good friend Eric Hatch and I started Sell a Home, Save a Child.What is Sell a Home, Save a Child? Itâs a movement. More specifically, itâs a collaboration of agents, title companies, mortgage representatives, builders, transaction coordinators, and other professionals in the real estate industry all around the country who want to make a difference in kidsâ lives.âWant to join the Sell a Home, Save a Child movement?âFor every home sold through this program, we donate 10% of our commission to Forward Edge International to help transform the lives of children in Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Kenya, Mexico, and the US. Our goal last year was to raise $1 million. We fell just short of that mark, but we still raised $900,000. That sum can make a big difference in a lot of kidsâ lives around the globe.How can you partner up with Sell a Home, Save a Child? If you have a home you need to sell or you know someone who does, give us a call. For the first home we sell each month, we donate 100% of our commission to Forward Edge International instead of just 10%. Some lucky seller out there will not only get top dollar for their home, but theyâll donate to a good cause at no cost to them whatsoever.If you have any other questions about Sell a Home, Save a Child or you have any other real estate needs I can assist you with, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

The National Association of Mortgage Brokers just came out with a list of the top 10 most overvalued markets in the country, and two Oregon markets made the list. These markets were Medford and Portland/Southwest Washington.So, is our local market about to crash?Before thinking about that, thereâs something else I want you to ask yourself.

If youâre purchasing property so that you can turn around and sell it in two years, youâve probably missed the boat a little bit.âIâm here to bring you facts, not fear.âHowever, we arenât in the same market freefall we were years ago. If we see depreciation soon, it will be very slow. Around the time of the crash in 2007, interest rates were at 6.5%. These days, weâre at a 4.45% interest rate. Thatâs a significant difference in terms of affordability.In short, I do not see our market crumbling at all. We can expect a slowdown, but Portland is still one of the most popular areas to move to in the US. Buying a home is still cheaper than renting. So, if you have plans to purchase a home it is still advisable to do so.

In early spring of last year, we had a number of buyers dropping out of the market because homes were seeing so many offers.As a seller, the fact that this will continue to be a trend is actually good news since the market is still highly stacked in the favor of sellers. We havenât had a traditional market of six monthsâ worth of supply in so long that I no longer believe that we can still define a traditional market that way.

Our Portland Metro area is the second-leading relocation market in the country. This is another great piece of news for sellers, but not so much for buyers.My advice to buyers is to look at homes that have been on the market for more than 30 days. Why? The seller almost certainly overpriced this home when they first put it on the market, and now theyâre decreasing that price to bring it closer to its true market value. This presents you with a great opportunity as a buyer.As for sellers, make your move now.

But the good news is that, depending on your credit score, we still have interest rates around 4%.Regardless of the fact that home values have risen, itâs still more affordable to own a home in our area than it is to rent, not to mention the tax benefits you get from homeownership.Another benefit of the 2018 real estate market is that supply is going up.

Second, we didnât have a big enough supply of homes on the market.âIf you need to sell, there is no reason to hesitate.âWe still have a massive number of people moving into the Portland/Southwest Washington area and weâre still the No. 2 relocation market in the country. If you need to sell, I think 2018 will be a boom year for you.I think weâll see a slowdown in the suburbs as far as appreciation goes, but weâve seen double-digit appreciation since 2012âthe biggest real estate growth rate in history. There is nothing out there that says weâll see a market downturn, and there is no indicator that there will be a bubble. If we have some natural catastrophe, there might be a little hiccup, but even if you look at areas like Houston or Florida, those markets have bounced back immediately. Why? Because the economy is growing. Jobs are growing.If you need to sell, there is no reason to hesitate. None of the tax changes did anything to the market, so itâs still very strong overall.If you have any other questions about our 2018 market or whether you should sell or not, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd be happy to help you.",

With the little time we have left, Iâd like to talk about an opportunity we have for you that will help a lot of kids.Thank you all for an incredible 2017! Â We had the opportunity to serve over 267 happy clients, and we wanted to thank you for helping us hit our goal of serving people and saving kids by selling real estate.We had a big goal for saving kids; we wanted to earn $1 million, and weâre a little over $920,000. We have an incredible opportunity for you.Â If you know anyone who is thinking about buying or selling real estate in the next 10 days, contact us. Our traditional 10% that we give back to the organization is now going to be 100%. Thatâs right: 100%! Why is that? Because we really want to hit that million-dollar goal.Most of all, thank you so much for coming out and seeing us two weeks ago at our client appreciation event and free Christmas tree giveaway. We gave more than 200 trees away, and over 400 people braved that terrible weather.We canât say it enough: Thank you so much for allowing us to fulfill our mission. Itâs been an incredible year, and I canât wait for 2018.In January, weâll talk about the new tax rules for real estate and what 2018 holds in store for our Portland/Southwest Washington real estate market.If you have any questions at all, feel free to contact me or my team.
