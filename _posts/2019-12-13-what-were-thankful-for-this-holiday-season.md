With the holiday season in full swing, my team and I have a lot to be thankful for—including you.

The holiday season is here, and I have a few special announcements to make.

First, my team and I have a lot for which to be thankful. We were able to serve 274 clients in 2019, and we’re blessed to be able to do this.

Second, I want to thank everyone who joined us in the “Sell a Home, Save a Child” initiative. We’ve raised $1.6 million so far for underprivileged children.

Lastly, I want to thank you. Without you, we wouldn’t be able to do what we do. It’s been a great year—the market started out slowly but picked up steam, and we’re proud to be able to live our mission, which is to serve you.

Until 2020, I wish you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year.
