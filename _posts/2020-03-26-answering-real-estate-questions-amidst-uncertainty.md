<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I’ve been hearing a lot of questions lately about how this pandemic is affecting real estate and the way business is done. Here are my answers to some of the most common ones.</em></p>

We are in an unprecedented time and there is a lot of fear and uncertainty out there. Over the last 15 years, I’ve had the opportunity to spend a lot of time in third-world countries where many people don’t necessarily know if they’re going to eat tomorrow.&nbsp;

The human spirit is incredibly resilient, and I hope you’re not sick. No matter how bad it gets, **we’re probably never going to face scarcity of food or water,** especially here in Oregon.

I’m not taking this lightly, but I do have a choice in what I focus on. Today I want to focus on whether or not you can still sell a home in today’s market if you need to do so.

There are several different options for you to consider if you are thinking about selling. The My Rocket Listing program is still active and can purchase your home without listing it or even having any showings. If you do want to show the home to buyers but don’t want people in it, we can show it virtually.

Are buyers and sellers still able to close on their homes? Absolutely. I talked with a title company president recently who has had discussions with all the different counties around the area and they are still moving forward to record real estate transactions.&nbsp;

There are about eight things that do have to be signed with a notary to close, so title companies are trying to get an exemption from the state that would allow them to do a visit via Zoom to get those documents signed. You can do this right now in other states, and Oregon is trying to get that done too. Even without this rule, **you can still close.**

I’ve also heard a lot of people out there talking about not being able to get a jumbo loan. Although they’ve become more expensive, you can still get one.

I hope this clears up some myths for you in this uncertain time. We didn’t have a choice about this pandemic happening, but we do have a choice about how we respond.

If you have questions for me or need anything at all, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
