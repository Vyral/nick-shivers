<p style="text-align: center;"><em>With so much new technology coming to the real estate industry, many people are wondering if a professional agent is still necessary when buying or selling a home. They are, and here are four good reasons why.</em></p>

**Today’s topic: Are agents still relevant?** In the age of algorithms, instant offers, and robots, do agents still matter?

Because I am an agent and not a robot, I’m going to argue that great, experienced agents will never go out of style. **Here are four reasons why:**

**1\. Expertise.** Recently, an instant offer program offered one of our clients a price that seemed fair. However, when they called us up to ask what we thought about the offer, I knew that the problem was that their zoning had just gotten changed. This means that the homeowner would end up only selling the home for about ⅓ of what they should have gotten. Nothing can replace an agent’s expertise. You won’t get that from AI, instant offers, or robots.

**2\. Compliance.** Unfortunately, there are a lot of people in our world who like to sue. AI and instant offer programs won’t be able to monitor the transaction process to make sure that everything you’re doing is compliant. Only an experienced agent can do that.

**3\. Connections.** We recently had a client who was looking for a home in Stafford/Wilsonville around $1 million. We couldn’t find much right away, but we ended up using our connections to help them find a house.

**4\. Uncovering motivations.** It’s not always about the price. There is a reason why people choose to buy or sell real estate, and you have to know that. That’s where our experience comes into play.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime about the market or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
