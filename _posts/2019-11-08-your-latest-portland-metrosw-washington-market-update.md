According to the latest numbers, year-over-year closed sales have increased the past two months in our market.

What do the latest numbers say about our Portland Metro/Southwest Washington market?

**It’s getting colder outside, but our Portland market has been seasonally hot lately.** Although the number of overall closed sales in 2019 is down 1.9% year over year, for the last two months, we’ve seen them increase: September rose 4.6% and October rose 0.9%. Appreciation also rose 1.4% last October, which means home values are still rising, but they’re doing so a lot slower. The average sales price for October, meanwhile, was $459,000.

In Southwest Washington, things slowed down a little bit in October. The number of closed sales increased 3% year over year, but that’s a considerable drop from the 8% increase we saw in September.

**Year over year, we’re about even as far as sales go, but Southwest Washington has done a little better than Oregon.** Why did the number of closed sales increase the last two months? Interest rates have been pushing buyers forward, buy they’ve gone up lately, hence the slowdown.&nbsp;

Here are the top five hottest markets in both areas:

5\. Hillsborough/Rock Creek<br>4\. Tigard/Metzger<br>3\. North Tabor/Hollywood<br>2\. Beaverton/Aloha<br>1\. Oregon City/Happy Valley&nbsp;

In weather parlance, our area in general is a balmy 67&deg; to 75&deg;.
