What’s the deal with selling to iBuyers? Today we’ll separate fact from fiction by sharing four common iBuyer myths.

There’s a lot of misinformation out there surrounding iBuyers, which is why today we’re going to shed light on a few of the examples. Here are four of the most common iBuyer Myths:&nbsp;

**Myth No. 1: “All iBuyer offers are lowball offers.”** This is not the case. Our team has sold a number of our properties to iBuyers like Zillow and Opendoor.

**Myth No. 2: “You can’t negotiate with iBuyers.”** If this were true, it wouldn’t have been possible for our team to negotiate an offer from an iBuyer up by $10,000 for one of our clients—something we were recently able to do. On top of that, we were also able to renegotiate a difference of $12,000 following the inspection period. It just goes to show that negotiating with iBuyers is possible.

**Myth No. 3: “The offer is ‘as is’.”** While it’s true that your home can be sold to an iBuyer in its current condition, it’s not true that this won’t affect the deal. If you have damage to your roof, for example, they will take this into account.

**Myth No. 4: “You don’t need an agent when selling to an iBuyer.”** You might think that selling to an iBuyer cuts out the necessity to hire a Realtor, but this couldn’t be further from the truth. It’s more important than ever to be represented during this kind of sale. Otherwise, you could leave a lot of money on the table.
