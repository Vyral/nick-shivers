<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Should you list your home during the holidays? Find out today.</em></p>

Many people have been asking if they should list their home during the holidays. Can they even sell a home this time of year?

Generally, **if you need to sell your home, my answer is yes, you should sell it during the holidays.** Let’s look at some of the historical data:

December, January, and February are traditionally the slowest months in all of real estate. Why? Because there are typically fewer buyers, and people often start taking their homes off the market right around Thanksgiving. That means, in general, you’ll have less competition, and the remaining buyers tend to be more serious this time of year.

That said, there are two factors that we need to look at that will differentiate this from previous years.

For one, **economists believe that by 2021, a recession may hit.** So, if you have to sell your home by the end of this year, the holiday season isn’t the worst time to do so. Secondly, interest rates will likely stay flat in the first quarter of 2020.

If you know that you have to sell sooner, here are a few tips to keep in mind:

Keep your holiday decorations simple.

Keep your home cozy; use lots of lighting.

Keep your listing photos and videos professional. Buyers don’t want to see snow in the yard or a dark and dreary sky; they want to see vibrant photos that will help them get a feel for your property.

If you have any questions about selling your home this holiday season or other real estate questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help you.
