What’s happening in our real estate market? Today I want to share the latest numbers and explain what they mean for you. First, **I’ll compare the numbers from July 2022 to July 2021.**&nbsp;

Portland Metro

Active listings: Down 5%

Pending listings: Down 14%

Sold listings: Down 11%

Clark County

Active listings: Down 2%

Pending listings: Down 13%

Sold listings: Down 11%

Things have definitely changed**.** Many experts predicted that our market would slow down due to rising interest rates, and we can definitely see that in these numbers. **So how has our market fared month over month?**

Portland Metro

Active listings: Down 13%

Pending listings: Down 23%

Sold listings: Down 43%

You may look at those numbers and think that our market is crashing, but it’s important to remember that our pandemic market was a bit of an anomaly. Instead, **let’s compare our current numbers to our last “normal” market, which was in 2019.**

Portland Metro

Active listings: Down 9%

Pending listings: Down 2%

Sold listings: Up 7%

As you can see, these numbers are much less concerning. In fact, sold listings are up. I’m not telling you that our market is going back to the crazy-fast pace we saw in 2021. Instead, it looks like our market is returning to where it was before the pandemic, which is still fantastic.&nbsp;

I don’t believe you have to worry about a crash. Inventory is increasing, but it’s still historically low. Millennials are still entering the market as first-time buyers, and there still aren’t enough homes to meet demand. As long as this remains the case, home prices will stay high.&nbsp;
