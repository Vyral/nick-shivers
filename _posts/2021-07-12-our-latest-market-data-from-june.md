The national news reports real estate data that is about 90 days old, and local news lags at least 30 to 60 days. We list many properties and can spot weekly trends. So we want to provide you with the most up-to-date information.&nbsp;

First, in our last blog, we discussed moratoriums: Federally, they got pushed out another month, and state-wide they were pushed back two months. I believe that will slow down the number of properties we’ll see hitting our real estate market.&nbsp;

**Here’s the latest data you need to know comparing June 2021 to June 2020:**

* Active listings increased 13.3%
* Pending sales (homes under contract) increased 1.3%
* Homes sold increased 15%

These numbers are roughly the same for the Portland metro area, Clark County, and Polk/Marion County. June was the first month in 10 to 11 months where we saw more active listings compared to pending listings.

**Now let’s compare some of the data to June 2019:**

* Active listings fell 1% from 2019 to 2020
* Pending sales rose 17.8% from 2019 to 2021
* Homes sold rose 16% from 2019 to 2021

**Taking it one step further, let’s compare the numbers to June 2018:**

* Active listings shrunk 8.3% from 2018 to 2021
* Pending sales climbed 17.2% from 2018 to 2021
* Homes sold climbed 8.7% from 2018 to 2021

All this tells us our market is strong, it’s staying strong, and even though I think we’ll see a peak in the market around the first or second quarter of 2022, the market isn’t going down anytime soon.

If you have any questions about our market or real estate in general, call or email me. I would love to help you.
