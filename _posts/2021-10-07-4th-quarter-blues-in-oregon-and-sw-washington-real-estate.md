Are Oregon and Southwest Washington feeling the fourth-quarter real estate blues? Let’s look at the numbers and figure out if that statement is accurate.

**The first indicator we like to look at when determining the health of the market is showing activity.** If you don’t have showing activity, that’s a good indicator that you don’t have a lot of buying activity.&nbsp;

In August, we saw the first month of 2021 where we had fewer showings year over year. So when I say “real estate blues”, it’s tongue-in-cheek. If you were rating the spring and early summer on a temperature scale, it would be 110 degrees. Right now, we’re at 90 degrees and it’s starting to get a little cooler.

The showing activity for spring and early summer ranged from 15% to 200% higher than we saw in 2020. We’re now starting to see a normal slowdown as we head into the fall and the fourth quarter of 2021.

Another trend we have to look at is multiple offers. Nationwide, the percentage of properties receiving multiple offers has dropped from 71% to 59%. **Here in Portland and Southwest Washington, we’re hovering around 73% still.**

Fannie Mae is predicting that we’ll finish the year with 3.3% more home sales than we did in 2020. Their prediction for 2022 is that we’ll see 2% fewer sales due to a lack of inventory and affordability issues.

So far in our area, active listings are up, pending sales are up, and in September, we’ve started to see a dip in active sales. When we get into the fourth quarter, we typically see fewer buyers and sellers, but **overall the market is still incredible for sellers.** It’s going to be a long time before we catch up with demand. I don’t foresee double-digit appreciation this year, but I do anticipate appreciation nonetheless.

If you have any questions about the market, buying, selling, or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
