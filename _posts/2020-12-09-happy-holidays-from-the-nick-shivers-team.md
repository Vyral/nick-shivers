<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s an overview of our market and the outcomes of our charitable acts.</em></p>

It’s my last blog post of the year\! 2020 is almost out the door—thank goodness\! This year has been a challenge: fires, a pandemic, riots, a long election process, and more. We’ve seen everything we never expected to this year. Nevertheless, we made it through. **Our thoughts and prayers go out to all of you because everyone has been affected this year.&nbsp;**

The real estate market has been wild. The market shut down for about two weeks in Salem and Portland and about three and a half weeks in southwest Washington, but it came back white-hot. It’s still a seller’s market; we’ve had more pendings and sold listings with less inventory across the board, and it’s not changing. Typically, we see a slowdown in December and January, but we haven’t seen that at all this year.&nbsp;

Why? **Interest rates are still exceptional** (and they aren’t likely to change soon), and inventory is extremely low. When you’re stuck at home during a health crisis, your surroundings are much more crucial than they were in the past.

We just finished our 15th annual Christmas tree giveaway—thank you all for attending. We handed out over 200 trees this year\! If you missed it, we look forward to seeing you at our next event. Hopefully, we’ll be able to have our summer get-together.&nbsp;

Now for one of my favorite things I like to announce: About four years ago, my friend Eric Hatch and I started a movement called Sell a Home, Save a Child, and as of this year we’ve raised $2 million altogether. This improves children’s lives in Kenya, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Oaxaca, Mexico. We were also able to deliver blankets to the homeless because of our closing gifts, so **thank you for helping us help others.**

We served over 350 clients, friends, and family members in 2020. When you’re a client of ours, you become a family member. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for allowing us to serve you and trusting us with the largest asset that most people will ever buy or sell.&nbsp;

We wish you a merry Christmas, happy holidays, and a great new year. We look forward to serving you in 2021\! If you ever have any questions about the market or real estate in general, please reach out via phone or email. We would love to help you.
