<p style="text-align: center;"><em>After a down month, our real estate market is starting to rebound here in Southwest Washington and the Portland Metro. Here’s what I’ve been seeing lately.</em></p>

The numbers are in for April in Portland and Southwest Washington—let’s quickly go through them today. Although a lot of the country is very similar right now, real estate is hyperlocal, and things are a little bit different in our area.

**Let’s start in Southwest Washington. In April, our number of listings taken was down 45%, pending sales were down 26.5%, and closed sales dropped by 25.9%.**

**In the Portland Metro, listings taken were down 37%, pending sales were down 30%, and closed sales dropped 20%.**

May could very well be worse than April as far as closings go. In the $800,000 price point, closings are down 44%. This is a price point where you’ll need to be careful down the road.

**Here’s the good news.** In Washington in the last week, pending sales were down just 4%. In Portland, they’re only down 10%. People are not listing their houses, so this shows us there is a massive difference between supply and demand. Supply is staying super low, but demand is steadily rising.&nbsp;

In short, things are getting better. If you’re a seller, it’s time to get your home ready to list immediately because buyers are still looking online in heavy numbers.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for me about how you can attack this market as a buyer or seller, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
