<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The best time to list in 2019 is different from last year, and here’s why.</em></p>

May was the best time to list in 2018 for a few reasons: You would have received 6% more on your list price, 14% more views online through Zillow and Realtor.com, and 4% more walk-throughs. I think the same will be true in 2019, **but it’ll happen a month earlier in April.**

Last December, we were down 21% in sales year over year. January was almost in the double digits, and February was about a 5% decrease. Now that we’re toward the end of March, we’re also looking at about 4% to 5% fewer sales.&nbsp;

There’s still a lack of inventory, but more is expected to hit the market. **That’s why I think April will be the best time to list—there’ll simply be less competition for you to face.** After April, I expect we’ll see a dramatic increase in inventory, especially with South Washington’s new construction homes.

If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
