Today’s topic is my favorite topic: Our nonprofit movement, [<u>sellahomesaveachild.org</u>](https://www.sellahomesaveachild.org/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.&nbsp;**Sell a Home, Save a Child is a collection of real estate professionals around the country that give a portion of their profits back to the movement to help kids who need it.** I have a couple of cool updates to share with you.

First, we were recently able to hit the $2 million mark in money raised for the cause. Second, we have more members than we have ever had in the history of our movement.

We have a few big events coming up. **On August 21, we have our Over the Edge event.** We hope to see you out there. We have another huge event on August 18 with Brent Gove and Anthony Robbins in Dallas, Texas that we’re very excited about. Finally, Eric Hatch has his summit coming up.

Now, that $2 million doesn’t even include all of our friends, family, and colleagues who have also donated, participated, and sponsored children. From the bottom of our hearts: Thank you\!

This all goes back to our mission of serving people, and we’re excited to continue doing that in the future. **Thank you for your support in the past, present, and future.&nbsp;**

If you have any questions for me or real estate needs I can assist with, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
