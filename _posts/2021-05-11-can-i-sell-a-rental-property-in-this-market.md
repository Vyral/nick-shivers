Today we have a special guest, Doug Moe, who’s the brains behind 24/7 Properties’ property management. I receive this question many times daily: Can I sell my rental property in our current real estate market? With eviction moratoriums and pandemic issues, this is a great question. Doug is here to give us some insight into this matter.
