What makes My Rocket Listing better than Zillow or Open Door for Portland and Southwest Washington home sellers? I’ll explain today.

What is the difference between [My Rocket Listing,](https://www.myrocketlisting.com/){: target="_blank"} Zillow, and a new company coming to Seattle from Wall Street called Open Door?&nbsp;

First of all, **My Rocket Listing offers choices.** When I come out to your house and tell you what price it will sell for, that’s usually the price it will sell for. Traditionally, other real estate agents might guess at a price, hold a few open houses, and drop the price. However, we wanted to create something different.&nbsp;

Why? It turns out that 20% of consumers don’t want to go that traditional route. They want an offer immediately. So two years ago, we created My Rocket Listing to give you a suggested retail price and an offer price immediately.

You might be wondering, “Isn’t that the same as Zillow’s Instant Offers?” There’s actually a big difference: Zillow will not list your house. They will only buy it.&nbsp;

**The other problem is that you will probably lose money with Zillow.** For example, we have a property that we’re going to list for $450,000. We ran it on all the data sites, from Zillow to Trulia to Realtor.com. Zillow’s estimate was about $50,000 lower than Realtor.com, and I think the property will sell for about $15,000 less than Realtor.com’s estimate.

What does that mean? You would lose tens of thousands of dollars on that property if you went with Zillow’s Instant Offer.&nbsp;

**Zillow relies on data, which doesn’t work in markets like Portland and Southwest Washington** because the neighborhoods are so different. Data can’t pick that up, so if you don’t have instant knowledge of your specific area, you could be in trouble.&nbsp;

The same is true for Open Door. Open Door does a great job in Phoenix, AZ because a lot of those subdivisions are brand new. When you have 500 houses that are all the same, it’s easy to get data points. You can’t do that in Hawthorne or Belmont.&nbsp;

That’s why our program is designed to get you the maximum convenience and maximum value. My Rocket Listing is your best choice for choices.
