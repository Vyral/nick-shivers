Don’t make these three mistakes when you sell your home.

Even in today’s extremely hot seller’s market, home sellers still can make certain mistakes that could jeopardize their transactions. Today I’ll share the top three mistakes that sellers need to avoid if they want to come out on top:

**1\. Overpricing your property.** Currently, we’re facing historic lows in our inventory, and almost every property we list ends up receiving multiple offers. Don’t try to test the market by pricing your home above market value. The better the price, the more people will make an offer on it, which means you can ultimately get an above-market value price anyway. Overpriced homes tend to drive buyers away.

**2\. Accepting the first offer.** You might want to sell your house quickly, but you need to be patient. We always list our houses on Wednesdays or Thursdays and wait until Monday to consider offers. Now, if someone were to offer you $1 million for a $500,000 house, you should jump on it, of course. But in general, we’re here to help you sort through the offers you receive and help you pick the very best one, which may not be the first one you get.

**3\. Waiting too long to accept an offer.** I’ve had clients tell me that they’re not going to accept any offers for the first two weeks they’re on the market. Though patience is key, waiting too long can also be a mistake. There is so much demand in our market, but people won’t wait two weeks for you to make a decision; they’ll likely move on to another property. You could still sell your home after that time, but there’s a good chance that you’ll get less for it.

If you have any more questions about selling your home or anything else to do with real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.
